## Implementation Example: 

In the example below, we consider the popular university physics textbook, Concepts of Modern physics by Arthur Beisser, chapter 1: Relativity for the example. 

Example 1:  

Type the topic you want summarized: Time Dialation 

The principle of relativity dictates that measurements of space and time are not absolute but depend on relative motion between the observer and the observed. When an object moves, its clock ticks slower and its length contracts in the direction of motion. This phenomenon, known as time dilation, means that time intervals measured by observers in different inertial frames will differ. The proper time of an interval, measured by events occurring at the same location in an observer's frame of reference, is shorter than the time measured by an observer in a different frame.

Example 2: 

Type the topic you want summarized: Frame of reference 

In inertial frames, objects in relative uniform motion have identical properties. The behavior of object A, observed from frame S, is identical to the behavior of object B, observed from frame S', which is moving at constant velocity relative to S. In a collision, A and B rebound in opposite directions with the same speed. The round-trip time for A, as measured in frame S, is shortened due to the relative motion between the frames. Inertial frames are those in which Newton's first law holds, and all inertial frames are equally valid. Determining whether something is moving requires specifying a specific frame of reference.

Example 3: 

Type the topic you want summarized: Doppler Effect 

The Doppler effect, a change in frequency due to motion, is observed in both sound and light. It occurs because moving sound sources or observers alter the distance between sound waves, leading to higher or lower frequencies. In light, it is observed as a shift in the wavelength of the light emitted by moving objects. Astronomers use the Doppler effect to measure the speed of stars and galaxies, which provides evidence for the expanding universe.

Example 4: 

Type the topic you want summarized: Twin Paradox 

The principle of relativity states that measurements of space and time are not absolute but depend on the relative motion between an observer and the object being observed. This leads to time dilation and length contraction: moving objects experience slower time and shorter lengths in the direction of motion. As a result, from an outside observer's perspective, a spacecraft traveling near the speed of light appears shorter in length (but not narrower) and the clock on the spacecraft appears to run slower. This effect is reciprocal, meaning that objects on Earth appear shorter to the observer on the spacecraft.
